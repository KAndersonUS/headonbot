## headonbot

The [Front Page of the Internet][1] has an untold number of bots accessing and posting content every second. Some contribute valuable context, like [autowikibot][2], which replies to WikiPedia links with an article summary and other links.

Then there's headonbot. 

[This][3] is exactly what headonbot aspires to do – what it _only_ aspires to do.

Headonbot was written in Node.js using the [snoocore Reddit API driver][4]. This was my first go at writing a Reddit bot, and it hasn't been field tested yet. So, here's hoping the script stays alive long enough to beat this joke even further into the ground.
